        One of the things I miss the most is to go out and try new restaurants and cafe. So I thought the next closest thing would be to have a virtual trip, while waiting to be able to go out again.
        Since we're all stuck inside, I decided to collect all the memories I have from my favourite restaurants and cafes in Glagsow and put them in this blog.

        I have been wanting to go to this cafe for ages. One friday morning I decided to treat myself and have a trip to the southside to try it out. What a lush breakfast! That's excatly where I will go for brunch as soon as they open again.
        It is the cutest little cafe and the staff is even sweeter than the pancakes! I also peacked into the kitchen and I'm desperate to work in such a lovely and fun environment.

        I went to this cafe on a sunny saturday morning, together with my sister who came to visit me from Italy. The place was full of people all happily enjoying their brunch: the perfect atmosphere.  The service was really amazing and I wanted to try every single thing on the menu. 
        All the dishes had different twist, unxpected flavours and combination. I am really looking forward to be back and try something new.

<h2> Alchemilla </h2>

<p>
    I am not sure if I can find the words to describe how amazing the food was in this restaurant. Everything was so beatiful, balanced, delicate, but also surprising, new, unexpected.
    The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous, I love the warm colours of the walls and the style of tables and chairs. also it was lovely to being able to see the chefs while they were cooking.
    I am so looking forward to be back.

<h2> Curler's Rest </h2>

<p>
    The place I am more looking forward to be back to is just a regular pub with simple food and a homely atmosphere. 
    The food is tasty and comforting, the sofas are cosy, the lights are low. This is the place where I went on the first date with the most amazing guy I have ever met and who is now my boyfriend.
    I am looking forward to be back with him, have a pint and some fish and chips. Everything will be all right again.
